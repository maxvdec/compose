# Renderers

Renderers are the main parts that output the final image or let's you see your project on screen.
You can use renderers and their configurations to achieve different results of your code.
The most used renderers are centered on photo-realistic rendering and use techniques that are suited for that purpose.

## ``Thyme``
Thyme is the default rendering for the editing mode. 
It let's you see sharp shapes but without final rendering features like lights and shadows. It's based on Metal and really fast. You can set Thyme as the final renderer, but that will result in very simple renders.
